    <h2>Early Life</h2>

    <p>
      John Peter Smith was born on September 16, 1831, in Owen County, Kentucky,
      to Samuel and Polly (Bond) Smith. He was the eldest of six children. In
      1844, his family moved to Hartford, Connecticut in search of better
      opportunities. Tragically, both parents died that same year, leaving
      thirteen year old John and his siblings orphaned. He was placed under
      the guardianship of his cousin, William H. Garnett.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite these hardships, Smith demonstrated discipline and a love of
      learning. Under Garnett’s care, he attended local schools in Hartford
      and later enrolled at Franklin College in Indiana. By
      1850, he was admitted to Bethany College in West
      Virginia, where he excelled in mathematics, classical languages, and
      public speaking.
    </p>

    <p>
      In July 1853, Smith graduated with top honors, earning first prize in
      mathematics and ancient languages. While at Bethany, he was strongly
      influenced by Alexander Campbell, a leader in the Disciples of Christ
      movement, whose beliefs on service and civic responsibility shaped
      Smith’s lifelong commitment to education and public service.
    </p>

    <p>
      Later in 1853, Smith moved to Fort Worth, Texas, which at the time was
      little more than an abandoned army outpost. In January 1854, he
      converted the vacant army hospital into Fort Worth’s first school.
      Although poor health forced him to resign after only a few months,
      this effort marked the beginning of organized education in the city
      and established Smith as a community leader at just 22 years old.

      “The true strength of a city is found not in its walls or commerce,
      but in the learning of its people.”
