    <h2>Philanthropy</h2>
    <p>John Peter Smith believed that the strength of a city rested in the opportunities it provided for its people. Throughout his life, he gave generously of his land, wealth, and time to ensure Fort Worth would grow into a community that served all residents, not just the privileged few.</p>

        <h3>Land for Public Use</h3>
        <p>Smith donated large sections of land for cemeteries, parks, and churches. His gifts ensured that Fort Worth families would have places for worship, gathering, and remembrance, creating permanent landmarks that reflected community values.</p>

        <h3>Commitment to Education</h3>
        <p>His philanthropy began with the founding of Fort Worth’s first school in 1854. Even after stepping away from teaching, Smith continued to invest in public education by serving on the school board and supporting institutions that made learning accessible to children of all backgrounds.</p>

        <h3>Healthcare Legacy</h3>
        <p>In his will, Smith set aside land for a public hospital to care for those who could not afford medical treatment. This act of generosity led to the creation of John Peter Smith Hospital, which remains a vital healthcare institution for Tarrant County more than a century later.</p>

He gave to areas that would support the city such as, schools, hospitals, parks, and churches that continue to serve Fort Worth today. His legacy demonstrates how one leader’s generosity can shape a city for generations.</p>
