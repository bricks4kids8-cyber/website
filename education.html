    <h2>Education</h2>

    <p>
      Although John Peter Smith faced tremendous challenges after the loss
      of his parents in 1844, he quickly proved himself as a capable
      student. Under the guardianship of his cousin William H. Garnett, he
      received instruction in public schools near Hartford, Connecticut.
      His passion for learning helped him secure higher education
      opportunities that were rare for orphans of his time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Smith first attended Franklin College in Indiana,
      where he developed a liking for mathematics, writing, and
      rhetoric. By 1850, he was admitted to
      Bethany College in present day West Virginia, a
      respected liberal arts institution founded by Alexander Campbell.
      Campbell’s emphasis on civic responsibility and literacy
      shaped Smith’s views on education.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Bethany, Smith excelled academically and earned
      <em>first prize in mathematics</em>. His success reflected not only
      in his intelligence but also perseverance in the face of early
      hardship.
    </p>

    <p>
      Smith’s education did more than prepare him for personal success —
      it also laid the foundation for his civic leadership. Shortly after
      graduating, he moved to Fort Worth, Texas, where he established the
      settlement’s first formal school in January 1854. Although poor
      health prevented his long term teaching, this effort launched Fort
      Worth’s educational system.

      “Education was his first gift to Fort Worth, and it remained the
      cause he cherished above all others.”
