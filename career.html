    <h2>Career</h2>

    <p>
      John Peter Smith began his career in Fort Worth as a teacher and lawyer,
      but quickly expanded into business and civic leadership. In 1853, he
      purchased land that later became central to the development of downtown
      Fort Worth. He emerged as one of the city’s most active real estate
      investors, donating land for schools, churches, and parks to shape the
      growing community.
    </p>

    <p>
      Smith entered politics as Fort Worth’s mayor, serving multiple terms
      between the 1880s and 1890s. During his time in office, he focused on
      improving public infrastructure, expanding the school system, and
      advocating for better public health services. He played a major role
      in establishing permanent schools and supported education for both
      boys and girls.
    </p>

    <p>
      His most lasting contribution came in healthcare. Smith donated land
      and funds that helped establish the John Peter Smith Hospital, a
      cornerstone of public health in Tarrant County. This act ensured that
      underserved residents could access affordable medical care.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond politics and philanthropy, Smith served as a trustee for several
      educational and civic institutions. His combined work as a businessman,
      public servant, and benefactor earned him recognition as the
      “Father of Fort Worth Schools” and a pioneer of community healthcare
      in North Texas.
